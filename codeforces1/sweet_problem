You have three piles of candies: red, green and blue candies:

the first pile contains only red candies and there are r candies in it,
the second pile contains only green candies and there are g candies in it,
the third pile contains only blue candies and there are b candies in it.
Each day Tanya eats exactly two candies of different colors. She is free to choose the colors of eaten candies: the only restriction that she can't eat two candies of the same color in a day.

Find the maximal number of days Tanya can eat candies? Each day she needs to eat exactly two candies.

```cpp

#include<bits/stdc++.h>

void main()
{

int a[3];

int t;

while(t--)
{
cin>>a[0]>>a[1]>>a[2];
sort(a,a+(a.size());
if(a[2]<=a[0]+a[1];
cout<<(a[0]+a[1]+a[2])/2;

else

cout<<a[0]+a[1];
}
